Perfect crispness on the hash browns with a buttery flavor. I do think the cheese is a bit of an overload and took the suggestion of Baking Nana and cut back on the cheese. I didn\\'t measure the cheese - just eyeballed it. Not being sure about the eggs I poured them level with the muffin tin and they looked great.  This recipe turned into a perfect nonstick delight. Adding to my TNT folder. *UPDATE* These are my go to breakfast muffins. I still only use half of the recommended amount of cheese and I make double batches so I can freeze some. Refrigerated or frozen they microwave perfectly.</div> <div ng-show=\"::((item.text==undefined || item.text==null || item.text.length &lt;= 0) &amp;&amp; isPrivate)\" class=\"ng-hide\"> <a class=\"add-review-button light ng-scope\" target=\"_self\" data-ng-href=\"/recipe/231510/amazing-muffin-cups/?editReview=1\" data-recipe-link=\"\" href=\"/recipe/231510/amazing-muffin-cups/?editReview=1\"> <span class=\"icon icon-review\"></span>Add a review <span>or photo</span> </a> </div> </article> </div><!-- end ngSwitchWhen: --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Cook --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: WebLink --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Video --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: HalfCook --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Brand --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Creative --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Hub --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Community --> <!-- ngSwitchDefault:  --> </div> </article><!-- end ngRepeat: item in itemList --><article ar-infinite-scroll-page=\"\" class=\"grid-col grid-col--fixed-tiles gridad\" data-ad-container-masonry-autocollapse=\"\" data-masonry-brick=\"\" data-ng-repeat=\"item in itemList\" style=\"position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 2625px;\"> <div ng-switch=\"::item.itemType\"> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: ad --><div ng-switch-when=\"ad\" class=\"ng-scope\"> <div class=\"ad-search-grid ng-isolate-scope\" data-position=\"18\" ad-slot-type=\"::item.adType\"> <div style=\"margin: 0 auto;\" data-ad-slot-type=\"div-gpt-lazy-square-fixed-tier4\" id=\"sideLoadedSlotId3\"> <div id=\"div-gpt-lazy-square-fixed-3\" data-tier=\"4\" data-google-query-id=\"CPHA6fG36tICFViPYgodq1kGLg\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_3865/ar.mdp.com/tier4/profile_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"250\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"google_ads_iframe_3865/ar.mdp.com/tier4/profile_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_3865/ar.mdp.com/tier4/profile_0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" style=\"border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom;\" srcdoc=\"\"></iframe></div></div></div> <span class=\"advertisement\">ADVERTISEMENT</span> </div> </div><!-- end ngSwitchWhen: --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Photo --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Article --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Collection --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Review --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Cook --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: WebLink --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Video --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: HalfCook --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Brand --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Creative --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Hub --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Community --> <!-- ngSwitchDefault:  --> </div> </article><!-- end ngRepeat: item in itemList --><article ar-infinite-scroll-page=\"\" class=\"grid-col grid-col--fixed-tiles\" data-ad-container-masonry-autocollapse=\"\" data-masonry-brick=\"\" data-ng-repeat=\"item in itemList\" style=\"position: absolute; left: 608px; top: 2643px;\"> <div ng-switch=\"::item.itemType\"> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: ad --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Photo --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Article --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Collection --> <!-- ngSwitchWhen: Review --><div ng-switch-when=\"Review\" class=\"ng-scope\"> <article class=\"profile-review-card\"> <a target=\"_self\" data-ng-href=\"/recipe/257202/fabiennes-grilled-center-cut-pork-chops/\" data-recipe-link=\"\" class=\"ng-scope\" href=\"/recipe/257202/fabiennes-grilled-center-cut-pork-chops/\"> <img style=\"display: inline;\" data-ng-src=\"http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/4482218.jpg\" title=\"Fabienne\\'s Grilled Center Cut Pork Chops\" alt=\"Fabienne\\'s Grilled Center Cut Pork Chops\" data-original-src=\"http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/4482218.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"\" class=\"grid-col__rec-image ng-isolate-scope\" src=\"http://images.media-allrecipes.com/userphotos/250x250/4482218.jpg\" /> <h3 ng-bind=\"::item.recipe.title\" class=\"grid-col__h3 grid-col__h3--recipe-grid ng-binding\">Fabienne\\'s Grilled Center Cut Pork Chops</h3> </a> <div class=\"rated-review--stars\"> <div ng-bind=\"::(((item.submitter.userID == loggedInCookId) ?
